# Plans

- Post ascension buyer - buy as many upgrades as possible as fast as possible
    - Buy 10 of each down the list and then 100 up the list (this does not work well for early ascensions but very well for later ones)
      - A slight accelerator to this is to buy the most expensive possible and then go down from top to bottom
    - After above, buy as many grandmas and cursors as possible as soon as possible 
    - This strat should work off a 10ms timer (or in the game loop when converted to mod (must be fast))
    - Upgrade buyer should use Buy All if available
    - Calculate when to switch back to standard auto-clicker/buyer strat?
    - Note: current manual post assend buy pattern follows above pattern and is good for getting to max productivity before letting the basic auto-clicker/buyer do its thing.

- Post ascension Santa and Krumblor buyer
    - Santa is easy - BEFORE buying a tonne of upgrades above and after getting the season switcher upgrade, switch to christmas and then enable the (as yet to be created) santa buyer
        - The idea of this is to just get the Santa upgrade going early; the Auto Season Switcher can handle getting all the Christmas cookies
    - Krumblor buyer - AFTER buying as many buildings as possible, post ascension, click the dragon egg and then enable the (to be created) Krumblor upgrader
        - Early ascensions will require the addition of a Krumblor buy strat (its purpose being to override the default 'best buy' strat in order to buy the required number of buildings to upgrade the Krumblor level)

- Auto Season switcher
    - Not included in this switcher: Santa (special case above), Business Day (does not produce upgrades)
    - With the season switcher, enable each and wait for all seasonal cookies to be found and bought and get the upgrades

- Grandmapocalypse navigator
    - Buy enough grandmas to start the grandmapocalypse
    - Buy the grandmapocalypse upgrades (upgrade tech IDs starting with 15000)
    - There are a few ways of playing the grandmapocalypse. Getting all the upgrades gives a significant CpS bonus so you generally want them. You can then choose if you want to get the wrinkler bonus or appease the grandmas in cycles or permanently appease them:
      - Wrinklers + wraith cookies (good for idling and getting the wrinkler bonus later +20% ingested cookies +more with other bonuses)
      - Wrinklers + wraith -> Elder pledge -> Wrinklers - not sure about the benefits of this one (it lets you get the grandma bonuses and then go back to pure golden cookie boosts)
    - Add ability to auto switch to Krumblor Dragon Guts (wraith + wrinkler booster)
    - Maybe add a sub-strat to get the '5x elder pledge' achievement

- Maximize Cursor and Grandma buys
    - After getting a lot of the heavenly upgrades, cursors become really powerful and as many as possible should be bought
    - Mentioned above in the Post Ascension Buyer but there should be a separate buy strat which weights Cursors higher?

Pet your dragon
    - After getting pet your dragon, auto click it every 15 mins until all drops are obtained (upgrade ids starting with 25100)
